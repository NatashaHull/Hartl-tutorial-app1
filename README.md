# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: first application

This is the first application (and demo app) for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

This app includes the materials from chapters one and
two of the Hartl tutorial.  However, after finishing
chapter two, I decided that a few changes were
necessary in order for the site to make more sense,
like using user-names instead of user-ids on the
microposts page.  Moreover, I thought it'd be a
good idea for you to be able to get to the respective
user show page, and move around between the two
scaffolds.  This led to the changes for my the
most recent commit.
